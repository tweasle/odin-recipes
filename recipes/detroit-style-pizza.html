        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try this Detroit-style pizza recipe the next time you want a crunchy, 
            crispy, cheese-laden slice! Detroit-style pizza is often referred to 
            as a deep-dish pizza, but I don't think that accurately captures the 
            essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good pizza. It has the flavor 
            elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza and the texture of 
            a light and airy focaccia. If you use a properly shaped pan, the 
            edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly 
            unique experience.</p>
