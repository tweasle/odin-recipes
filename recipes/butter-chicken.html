        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These butter chicken breasts are dipped in beaten eggs and cracker crumbs, 
            then baked with butter. These chicken breasts are really tender and moist 
            with excellent flavor! I never have leftovers.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        </ol>
