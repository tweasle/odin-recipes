        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Try this Detroit-style pizza recipe the next time you want a crunchy, 
            crispy, cheese-laden slice! Detroit-style pizza is often referred to 
            as a deep-dish pizza, but I don't think that accurately captures the 
            essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good pizza. It has the flavor 
            elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza and the texture of 
            a light and airy focaccia. If you use a properly shaped pan, the 
            edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly 
            unique experience.</p>

        <h2>Chef's Note</h2>
        <p> If you can't get a classic Detroit pizza pan, you can use a 
            12-inch cast iron skillet. You may not need to use quite as 
            much dough, but it should be close. You can also use two 8-inch 
            square metal cake pans. No matter what pan you use, make sure 
            it's at least a few inches deep.

            All-purpose flour will work, but bread flour has more gluten 
            and works a little better.
                
            These pizzas are traditionally made with Wisconsin brick cheese, 
            so if you can find it, substitute 12 ounces of brick cheese for 
            the Monterey Jack and Cheddar. You can grate the cheese if preferred.
                
            Use any other toppings you like, just add them to the dough 
            before covering them with cheese.

                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Toppings<ul>
                    <li>8 oz Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                    <li>4 oz wild Cheddar cheese</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start the dough: Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted
                    with the dough hook attachment. Stir in yeast and sugar and let dissolve.
                    Add bread flour, 2 teaspoons of oil, and salt; knead until dough is 
                    very smooth, soft, and elastic.</li>
                <li>Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-in Detroit-style pizza pan;
                    use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough
                    in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and stretch dough
                    into a rectangular shape. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about
                    1 hour</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes,
                    and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for
                    15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (275 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Prepare the toppings: Dice Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into small cubes.
                    Combine in a bowl and toss to mix. Set out pepperoni slices.</li>
                <li>Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan.
                    Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into 
                    a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. 
                    Stretch dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.</li>
                <li>Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese cubes 
                    evenly over top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where 
                    dough meets the pan. Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. 
                    Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker 
                    than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into 9
                    rectangular pieces.</li>
            </ol>
